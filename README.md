# Portfolio Website
## Intro
This is the site for whatever (business portfolio preferably), whatever happens, this is where you'll find it. 
Whatever the weather, whatever the day, whatever the time.

Whatever.

It's responsive and cute-looking. The splashes of yellow will definitely brighten up your day.
